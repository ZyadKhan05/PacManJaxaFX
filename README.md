In order to Run you need to download and use the Java 9.0 SDK

For any carroll students, here is the link for the Java 9.0 SDK
https://carrollcc-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/zkhan_carrollcc_edu/EuDSs3gZedRBlk7cUq5cfGwBwQFxgGHziwifhpck1MvS4A?e=RgF9zv (Note that to open this link you have to sign into your carroll email, sigh...) 

Once the SDK is installed and the project is opened in Intelli, Select File -> Project Structure -> On the SDK dropdown under + Add SDK you should see an option to choose an SDK from your computer which should be 9.0 -> Once 9.0 is selected as the SDK, select the Language level dropdown menu and select SDK default on the top. 

For anyone that does not have a carroll email address, here is the direct link to the Oracle Java 9.0 SDK Download:
