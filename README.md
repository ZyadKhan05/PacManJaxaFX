# PacManJaxaFX
Pac-Man game in JavaFX for CIS232

In this branch you can find all of the game files. In the Pacman folder in this directory, you can find all of the java classes and resources used in the game. 

Additionally, there is a Word Document called Mert_guide which provides all information needed to run the game. 

Note that you need to be using Java 9.0 SDK in order to run the program as the Media Player does not work in 1.8. View the JavaSDK branch from the dropdown menu for an installer.
