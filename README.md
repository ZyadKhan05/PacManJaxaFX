In order to Run you need to download and use the Java 9.0 SDK

Once the SDK is installed and the project is opened in Intelli, Select File -> Project Structure -> On the SDK dropdown under + Add SDK you should see an option to choose an SDK from your computer which should be 9.0 -> Once 9.0 is selected as the SDK, select the Language level dropdown menu and select SDK default on the top. 

This whole process is dumb but blame Java.
