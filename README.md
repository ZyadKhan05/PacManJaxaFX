# PacManJaxaFX
Welcome to PakMan!

This project is a Pac-Man game coded with Java, JavaFX, and Java Swing for CIS-232-75 (Advanced Principles of Programming) at Carroll Community College 

In order to view the source code including the resources used, you will have to select the PakMan branch. This includes fonts, images, and sound effects. 

Note: You need to be using Java 9.0 SDK in order to run the program as the Media Player does not work in 1.8. View the JavaSDK branch from the dropdown menu for an installer.
